        <li> <strong class="title">Fresh Seafood </strong>- Fishermen haul in wahoo, snapper, shrimp, lobster, oysters, mahi-mahi, grouper, conch, and more fresh every day</li>
        <li><strong class="title">Dutch Pancakes</strong>- Similar to crepes, locals eat pannenkoeken filled with apple, bananas, or pineapples, for breakfast. For lunch or dinner, islanders dine on heartier versions with salami, ham, cheese, or tuna. </li>
        <li> <strong class="title">Pica di Papaya </strong>- Some like it hot. Very hot. If you do, try pica di papaya, an Aruban hot sauce. Key ingredients are the locally farmed Madame Jeanette peppers and papayas. The fruit adds a sweet note to the heat.</li>
